# Java projects
My bigger projects that I made for my CS studies. Recommended IDE is IntelliJ IDEA.
## AlpaMaze

## Calculator
Simple calculator operating on **BigIntegers** using JavaFX (which need to be installed separately).
## Calendar
Simple calendar app with a switch from Julian to Gregorian calendar. Made using Swift.
## Solitaire
Simple Solitaire game made with Swift. Supports British and European versions.
